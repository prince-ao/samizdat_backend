It includes contributions from expert philosophers of law. The chapters dig deep into important camps of Postema's rich theoretical project including:- the value of the rule of law;- the ideal of integrity in adjudication; - his works on analogical reasoning;- the methodology of jurisprudence; - dialogues with Ronald Dworkin, Joseph Raz, Frederick Schauer and HLA Hart.The collection includes an original article by Professor Postema, in which he develops his conception of the rule of law and replies to some objections to previous works, and an interview in which he provides a fascinating and unique insight into his philosophy of law.","isbm":"ISBN: 1509933883,9781509933884"},{"id":"3234315","title":"Dalmacija na raskršću 1848. god.","author":"Grga Novak","publisher":"Odjel za filozofijske, historijske, pravne društvene i ekonomske nauke - JAZU","year":"1948","language":"Croatian","format":"pdf","size":"19 Mb","pages":"294","link":"http://31.42.184.140/main/3234000/afb942a767592a512238bc04e13a4ff9/%28Rad%20Jugoslavenske%20akademije%20znanosti%20i%20umjetnosti%2C%20knjiga%20274%29%20Grga%20Novak%20-%20Dalmacija%20na%20raskr%C5%A1%C4%87u%201848.%20god.-Odjel%20za%20filozofijske%2C%20historijske%2C%20pravne%20dru%C5%A1tvene%20i%20ekonomske%20nauke%20-%20JAZU%20%281948%29.pdf","image":"http://library.lol/covers/3234000/afb942a767592a512238bc04e13a4ff9-g.jpg","description":"","isbm":"Publisher: Odjel za filozofijske, historijske, pravne društvene i ekonomske nauke - JAZU, Year: 1948"},{"id":"3234314","title":"Čeština pro cizince","author":"Karla Hronová, Milada Turzíková","publisher":"Fraus","year":"1998","language":"Czech","format":"pdf","size":"147 Mb","pages":"[323]","link":"http://31.42.184.140/main/3234000/12ea44d85c94cf326e2180db9bac65d8/Karla%20Hronov%C3%A1%2C%20Milada%20Turz%C3%ADkov%C3%A1%20-%20%C4%8Ce%C5%A1tina%20pro%20cizince-Fraus%20%281998%29.pdf","image":"http://library.lol/covers/3234000/12ea44d85c94cf326e2180db9bac65d8-g.jpg","description":"","isbm":"ISBN: 8072380281"},{"id":"3234313","title":"React: Up & Running: Building Web Applications","author":"Stoyan Stefanov","publisher":"O'Reilly Media","year":"2021","language":"English","format":"pdf","size":"15 Mb","pages":"232[233]","link":"http://31.42.184.140/main/3234000/936b3a2a52a852e7c4611e8cab0bd28c/Stoyan%20Stefanov%20-%20React_%20Up%20%26%20Running_%20Building%20Web%20Applications-O%27Reilly%20Media%20%282021%29.pdf","image":"http://library.lol/covers/3234000/936b3a2a52a852e7c4611e8cab0bd28c-g.jpg","description":"Description:Hit the ground running with React, the open source technology from Facebook for building rich web applications fast.

With memory forensics, you can not only gain key insights into the user's context but also look for unique traces of malware, in some cases, to piece together the puzzle of a sophisticated targeted attack.\n\nStarting with an introduction to memory forensics, this book will gradually take you through more modern concepts of hunting and investigating advanced malware using free tools and memory analysis frameworks. This book takes a practical approach and uses memory images from real incidents to help you gain a better understanding of the subject and develop the skills required to investigate and respond to malware-related incidents and complex targeted attacks. You'll cover Windows, Linux, and macOS internals and explore techniques and tools to detect, investigate, and hunt threats using memory forensics. Equipped with this knowledge, you'll be able to create and analyze memory dumps on your own, examine user activity, detect traces of fileless and memory-based malware, and reconstruct the actions taken by threat actors.\n\nBy the end of this book, you'll be well-versed in memory forensics and have gained hands-on experience of using various tools associated with it.\n\nWhat you will learnUnderstand the fundamental concepts of memory organizationDiscover how to perform a forensic investigation of random access memoryCreate full memory dumps as well as dumps of individual processes in Windows, Linux, and macOSAnalyze hibernation files, swap files, and crash dumpsApply various methods to analyze user activitiesUse multiple approaches to search for traces of malicious activityReconstruct threat actor tactics and techniques using random access memory analysisWho this book is for\nThis book is for incident responders, digital forensic specialists, cybersecurity analysts, system administrators, malware analysts, students, and curious security professionals new to this field and interested in learning memory forensics. A basic understanding of malware and its working is expected. Although not mandatory, knowledge of operating systems internals will be helpful. For those new to this field, the book covers all the necessary concepts.","isbm":"ISBN: 9781801070331"},{"id":"3234298","title":"Cześć i całość.

Using extensive archival material from national, regional and town archives, Alexandre Sumpf explores the treatment of these veterans by the state, their battle for legal status and their right to both collective and individual health care. He shows how the question of disabled veterans became bound up in broader political and social debates in the early 20th century and fostered healthcare and social welfare policy. The experience of these 1.14 million war veterans reconfigured notions of heroism, sacrifice and patriotism while the period of 1915-1919 was marked by extensive political activism by disabled veterans. Dr Sumpf illustrates how the Bolsheviks condemned disabled veterans as the symbol of the “imperialist war” and brutally negated their rights as part of the broader devaluation of the war experience in early Soviet Russia.","isbm":"ISBN: 1316517748,9781316517741"},{"id":"3234296","title":"Access and Mediation: Transdisciplinary Perspectives on Attention","author":"Elizaveta Solomonova (editor); Maren Wehrle (editor); Diego D'Angelo (editor)","publisher":"De Gruyter","year":"2022","language":"English","format":"pdf","size":"10 Mb","pages":"[304]","link":"http://31.42.184.140/main/3234000/513f3c90dd55bc5e5ebfb09c2867107b/%28Age%20of%20access%29%20Elizaveta%20Solomonova%20%28editor%29_%20Maren%20Wehrle%20%28editor%29_%20Diego%20D%27Angelo%20%28editor%29%20-%20Access%20and%20Mediation_%20Transdisciplinary%20Perspectives%20on%20Attention-De%20Gruyter%20%282022%29.pdf","image":"http://library.lol/covers/3234000/513f3c90dd55bc5e5ebfb09c2867107b-g.jpg","description":"","isbm":"Publisher: De Gruyter, Year: 2022"},{"id":"3234295","title":"交锋地带","author":"佩里·安德森","publisher":"中国社会科学出版社","year":"2008","language":"Chinese","format":"pdf","size":"102 Mb","pages":"437[458]","link":"http://31.42.184.140/main/3234000/2a74e120efe34934ed276418247f77e8/%28%E7%9F%A5%E8%AF%86%E5%88%86%E5%AD%90%E5%9B%BE%E4%B9%A6%E9%A6%86%29%20%E4%BD%A9%E9%87%8C%C2%B7%E5%AE%89%E5%BE%B7%E6%A3%AE%20-%20%E4%BA%A4%E9%94%8B%E5%9C%B0%E5%B8%A6-%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E7%A4%BE%E4%BC%9A%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E5%87%BA%E7%89%88%E7%A4%BE%20%282008%29.pdf","image":"http://library.lol/covers/3234000/2a74e120efe34934ed276418247f77e8-d.jpg","description":"Description:本书是当代英国著名的马克思主义理论家佩里·安德森的代表作。是一部辩论之作，应战之书。作者在此书中对他所感兴趣的理论对手展开回应和批评。这其中包括自由主义思想家的伯林、现代性理论家伯曼、左翼政治理论家昂格尔、民族主义理论家盖尔纳、历史学宗师布罗代尔，还有美国右翼理论家福山等。作者采用的立场是马克思主义的，他对这些理论对手的辩驳，代表了英国马克思主义的最高水准。","isbm":"Publisher: 中国社会科学出版社, Year: 2008"},{"id":"3234294","title":"New knowledge in human values","author":"Abraham H.
